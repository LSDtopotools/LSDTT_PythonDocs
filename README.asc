= Documentation for plotting routines written in python for LSDTopoTools

If you just want the documentation go here: https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_PythonDocs/[Python doc website].
The below instructions are for updating the docs and building the website. 

You will meed to install https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[ruby], https://rubygems.org/[rubygems] and http://bundler.io/[bundler] to get it working. 

Install the ruby package `bundler` using

[source,console]
----
$ gem install bundler
----

== Turning these files into pdf or html

NOTE: If you want to set up your own book and website, skip to the next section. These instructions are just for turning the template into pdf and html files. 

We will use http://bundler.io/[bundler], which manages http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] and a a bunch of other stuff, to turn these files into pdf and html. The template files do this work for you so all you need to do to egt started is install https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[ruby], https://rubygems.org/[rubygems] and http://bundler.io/[bundler] and then clone this repository into the directory of your choice from Github.

Once you have bundler installed, you can build the book with:

[source,console]
----
$ bundler install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
----

This will build *html* and *pdf* versions of the book.

You can also build an html only version:

[source,console]
----
$ bundler install
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----

WARNING: The build process will make a folder called `images` in the root directory,
which on some systems must be deleted before new builds. This is a particular problem on Windows systems, where sometimes windows will stupidly not let you delete the `thumbs.db` file it automatically generates. To get around this, right click on the images directory and unselect `read only`, then you should be able to delete the folder. In general, however, as long as you do not look in the images directory you will not have this problem. 

== If you are making changes to this template

NOTE: You can ignore this unless you are helping write the template and have push permission. Currently this applies to nobody so they are more notes for myself to remember how I set up this repository. 

I do not want any messy merging conflicts! To avoid this please keep the *master* and *gh-pages* separate on your computer!

. When checking out the code, check them out into two directories:
+
[source, console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_PythonDocs.git master
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_PythonDocs.git gh-pages
----
+
. In the gh-pages directory, check out the gh-pages branch and get rid of the master branch:
+
[source, console]
----
$ cd gh-pages
$ git checkout origin/gh-pages -b gh-pages
$ git branch -d master
----
+
. Now, go back to the master branch, you can make changes there. 

. When you commit changes to the master branch and you want to update the website, commit and push changes, then run bundle:
+
[source, console]
----
$ pwd
my/path/to/website/master/
$ git commit -m "My latest commit" .
$ git push -u origin master
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----
+
. Now copy any new image files to the /images folder in the gh-pages branch (you will need to git add them), 
and rename *LSDTT_PythonDocs.html* to *index.html* and copy to the gh-pages folder. 
+
[source, console]
----
$ pwd
my/path/to/website/gh-pages/
$ cd images
$ git add <filenames of new images>
$ cd ..
$ git commit "updating website" .
----
+
. Now push the changes to the gh-pages branch
+
[source, console]
----
$ bundle exec rake book:build_html
----
+
[source, console]
----
$ pwd
my/path/to/website/gh-pages/
$ git push -u origin gh-pages
----
