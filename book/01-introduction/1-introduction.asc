== Background and Motivation

This documentation describes plotting scripts, written in https://www.python.org/[python] that are used to plot output from http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools]. If you are looking for inforamtion on how to use *LSDTopoTools*, see our https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTopoTools_workshop/[workshop documentation] or our http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/[full documentation]. 

The output from http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools] is compatible with GIS software, so why would we write plotting scripts? The reason is that we want plotting tools that are totally reproducible: if you use our data and scripts you can get exactly the same figures that we get. Our objective is for anyone who reads our papers to be able to produce the exact same publication-ready figures that we had in the paper. 

In addition, it can be very annoying to import layers into a GIS repeatedly and have to click loads of buttons selecting formatting, colour schemes, transparancies, etc. These scripts automate that process so you don't have to do a bunch of clicking. 

We aim to use these scripts to compress our workflows, and hope that other users will benefit. One example is our http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013JF002981/abstract[chi mapping] methods: in 2014 it took several weeks of concerted effort to get chi maps at a landscape scale and turn them into publication-ready figures. That process now takes a few hours thanks to these scripts. 

Our scripts have seen much less development than our acutal analysis code (that is *LSDTopoTools*) and this documentation reflects the fact that these tools are incomplete. However, if you are a user of *LSDTopoTools* you can keep checking back and hopefully this documentation will grow through time,
