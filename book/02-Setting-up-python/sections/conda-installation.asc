=== Setting up Python with Miniconda

Hopefully this will be both simple and painless. You will need to be connected to the internet.

. Download and install the **python 2.7** version of http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[Miniconda] for your operating system. 
+
IMPORTANT: You *MUST* use python 2.7 because our scripts use a package called https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/[GDAL] that is not compatible with python 3!
+
. Once you have installed miniconda, you can go into a powershell (windows) or terminal (MacOS and Linux) and get the other stuff you need:
+
[source,consol]
----
  PS> conda install scipy
  PS> conda install matplotlib
  PS> conda install pandas
  PS> conda install gdal
  PS> conda install spyder
----
+
. To run Spyder you just type `spyder` at the command line. 
+
WARNING: Spyder needs an older version of a package called *PyQt*. If spyder doesn't start correctly, run `conda install pyqt=4.10 -f` 
+
WARNING: For Spyder to work you will need a windowing system so you cannot run it through a text-only server. That means if you are using a https://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTopoTools_workshop/#_starting_up_on_a_non_linux_operating_system_windows_macos[vagrant machine] you should install pyhton on your host computer and not on the vagrant machine. 
+
. Everything should be set up. Yay!!
