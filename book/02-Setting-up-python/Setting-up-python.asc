== Setting up Python

https://www.python.org/[Python] is an open source programming language popular with scientists and engineers. You will need to both set up python and install the appropriate packages for our scripts to work. To do this, we use http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html[Miniconda], which works on all common operating systems (Linux, Windows and MacOS) and makes installation and updates of python packages very simple. 

NOTE: There are a number of ways to install python but we find miniconda the best because it is lightweight and easy to update (c.f. https://www.continuum.io/downloads[anaconda], http://python-xy.github.io/downloads.html[python(x,y)]).
